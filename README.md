# Weather analysis of worldwide destinations utilizing Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals

## Project Description:
Through utilizing Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals, the project serves to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator by using OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities. Then, plots of the following were created: 


- Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

- Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

- Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

- Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

Then, a Geoapify API was utilized to create a map that displays a point for every city that was chosen as a vacation destination point.
